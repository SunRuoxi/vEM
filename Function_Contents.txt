Functions: 

(1)FALCON function
background_estimation: estimate background of raw images.  
Gauss_kernel: gaussian kernel.  
handover:  find indices of particles which are close to adjacent grid points.  
Peakdets_range: estimate estimator position from a blur (intensity-weighted). 
vEM_Gen_kernels: prepare for FALCON's optimization (FALCON uses composite PSF, i.e. two weighted sum gaussians as PSF. We only use one gaussian for simplicity)


(2) vEM
vEM_simulation: simulated images data and write into obs.tif file 
vEM_updates: perform variational EM anaysis
vEM_WriteImage: write data into tif file. 
plot_CheckLikelihoodPeak: plot laplace approximation against poisson likelihood. 
q2image: reconstructed a 2d image from one q distribution. 
VB_qDistribution: reconstructed a 2d image from one q distribution or all q distributions from the same frame. 
vEM_FALCON: FALCON algorithm. Changed a few default parameters to increase sparsity to achieve the best performance. 
vEM_constrained_FALCON: constrained FALCON
vEM_pretrain_hessian: use Automatic differentiation (AD) (package: adigator) to pre-calculate hessians, and save them to avoid re-calculation 
vEM_HessianInStock_qdist: plug values into the pretrained hessians, refine (optimize over fluorophore position Fi), and generate q distributions. 
adigatorGenHesFile_ChangeOuputOrder: accessary function to use adigator package (i.e. change the output order of adigator for optimization function fmincon, which requires inputs in the order of function, gradient and hessian)
vEM_FALCON_EmittersToImage: FALCON's output is a list of emitters position. This function reconstructs an image from the list of emitters. 
vEM_GetLambda0_weighted: vEM's output are q distributions. This function reconstructs an image from the q dsitributions. When reconstruction, we could choose to weight q distribution by fluorophores intensity or not. 


(3) Evaluation 
for accuracy of individual fluorophores:  the two functions below are essentially the same. As the output of FALCON and vEM are different. FALCON are a list of emitters positions. vEM are a bunch of q distributions. 
The second function uses intensity-weighted sum of q distributions to transfer them into the form of FALCON. 

vEM_evaluation_FALCON: evaluation for FALCON  
vEM_evaluation_q_dist: evaluation of refine or vEM


for accuracy of overall reconstructed image: 
vEM_evaluation_overall: evaluation of final resolved image 

vEM_PlotEvaluation_individual: plot evaluation results for individual 
vEM_PlotEvaluation_overall: plot evaluation results for overall
