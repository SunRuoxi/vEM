Folders: 
(1) function: functions required by the model. 
(2) adigator: matlab automatic differentiation package
https://sourceforge.net/projects/adigator/?source=typ_redirect
Add the above two folders to matlab path. 


The main function is NON_Markov.  This code is for windows machine only.
