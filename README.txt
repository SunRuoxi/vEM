This code was demonstrated in MATLAB 2016a version with CPU
We show the non-Markov model, including the six steps of the non-Markov model.

Folders: 
(1) function: functions required by the model. 
(2) adigator: matlab automatic differentiation package
https://sourceforge.net/projects/adigator/?source=typ_redirect
Re-direct to vEM folder. Add the above two folders to matlab path. 
(Note that adigator has an issue on matlab 2016b. Fixed here. If you download from adigator from source page, please fix the issue according to https://sourceforge.net/p/adigator/discussion/bugs/thread/84ad9556/?limit=25) 


The main function (demo) is NON_Markov.
